## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

I am using Anaconda and Jupyter notebook with Python versions 3.
Below are the libraries being used explicitly:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn
- keras

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose New York Stock Exchange Data Analysis.

I love investing in Tech Stocks, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here and see the trend for the past years.


My key interests would be:

- 1.Best Tech Stocks 
- 2.Highest Return on Long-term investment in Apple and Amazon. 
- 3.Predictions using LinearRegreesion 
- 4.Predictions using LSTM 
- 5.Which one is better LSTM and LinearRegression for Stock Predictions?.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse - downloaded from kaggle.

First the Analysis is done with Linear Regression and then LSTM Prediction.
So pick a Particular Stock such as Amazon.

1. LinearRegression-Amazon.ipynb - notebook where i did my analysis to find answers to my questions using LinearRegression
2. LSTM-Amazon.ipynb - notebook where i did my analysis to find answers to my questions using LSTM


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://vishalden493.medium.com/apple-or-amazon-which-stock-is-better-stock-market-analysis-5ded19483add)
> Thanks Udacity.

## Acknowledgements<a name="acknowledgement"></a>
Must give credit to Udacity courses (thank you very much) for some of code ideas, and to kaggle for the data. The use of Data Science to wrangle data to get answers is amazing.
