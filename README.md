# Installation
I am using Anaconda and Jupyter notebook with Python versions 3. Below are the libraries being used explicitly: numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn seaborn keras

# Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose New York Stock Exchange Data Analysis.

I love investing in Tech Stocks, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here and see the trend for the past years.

# My key interests would be:

1.Best Tech Stocks 
2.Highest Return on Long-term investment in Apple and Amazon. 
3.Predictions using LinearRegreesion 
4.Predictions using LSTM 
5.Which one is better LSTM and LinearRegression for Stock Predictions?.

# File Descriptions:

LinearRegression-Apple.ipynb - notebook where i did my analysis to find answers to my questions using LinearRegression
LSTMGOOG.ipynb - notebook where i did my analysis to find answers to my questions using LSTM

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available

# Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle for the data. The use of Data Science to wrangle data to get answers is amazing.
